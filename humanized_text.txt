Summary of Content and Main Arguments
Perlstein states that Before the Storm is a historical account starting post-Eisenhower, characterized by the emergence of moderate Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller and the prevalence of a liberal consensus. In the initial chapters of this publication, we encounter a depiction of america in the 1950s, during which the majority of americans, regardless of political orientation, supported the principles of the new deal welfare state and cold war containment. Enter perlstein with a fresh roster of conservative radicals: intellectuals such as william f. Jr. and the national review crowd and the grassroots activists of the new sunbelt and the rich donors and the young organizers who believed in small government, big loud anti communism. The story concludes at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, where Goldwater is nominated as the party candidate by what Perlstein refers to as conservative domination of the party machinery. The writer tells in detail how republicans talked about their ideas, what the people working for the campaign did, and the fights inside the group of conservatives. The writer gives a close look at talks about belief, things done for votes, and the problems within the right side. Perlstein underscores Goldwaters assertion that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice as indicative of the movement, which prioritizes ideological purity over pragmatic electoral considerations. Coverage of it would be mostly on the bigger campaign, perlstein wrote, of how goldwater s errors caused his landslide defeat and the structural forces that would turn out to be stronger in the end. l. j. victory must not be interpreted as a praise of liberalism, but as a blow to a movement that had already begun to alter the political culture of the united states. Perlstein’s main point is that the 1964 race set the basic tools for wins for conservative groups later on. This race helped build a wide group of people and groups who worked together, aimed at key groups of voters, worked on making speech and talk better, and, most of all, showed that strong views can be kept if people keep trying in politics even when they lose votes. Perlstein perceives a recurring pattern: the conservative media empire expands, recognized by the affluent benefactors as a revenue generator, religious conservatives are activated, the middle class is alarmed by the destabilization of the existing social order, and anti elitism and anti intellectualism are utilized as tools. According to him, the Goldwater campaign injects ideological confrontation into American politics and concludes the bipartisan consensus that defined the postwar era. Perlstein contended that the movement 's focus on individualism, state independence, and anti-communism would ultimately appeal to the electorate, which was fatigued by bureaucratic liberal excess and disillusioned by the increase in social disorder.
