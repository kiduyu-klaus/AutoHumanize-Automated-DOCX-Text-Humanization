At present, the majority of healthcare institutions utilize relatively simplistic methodologies for addressing readmission risk. The primary approach is one-size-fits-all discharge planning, where every patient receives identical discharge instructions without consideration of individual risk factors. This method does not provide the supplementary focus and targeted interventions required by high-risk patients post-discharge (Kansagara et al., 2011). In many settings, clinicians may depend on intuition and experience to identify high-risk patients, but this method does not exhibit uniform accuracy and can miss subtle indicators of risk that a predictive algorithm, trained on available data, might detect more reliably.

Certain hospitals employ basic risk prediction instruments, such as the LACE index (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidities, and Emergency department use). Although beneficial, such tools utilize only a subset of potential variables and thus may not fully account for the complexity of readmission risk (van Walraven et al., 2010). Current systems are reactive rather than proactive, identifying problems only once readmission has occurred, rather than providing early detection during the critical post-discharge phase.

Resource limitations also restrict healthcare providers from offering extensive follow-up to every patient. Consequently, these individuals, who would most benefit from careful oversight and prompt assistance, may not obtain it, leading to unnecessary readmission.
