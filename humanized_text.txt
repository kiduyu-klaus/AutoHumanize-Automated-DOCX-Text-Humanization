Book review: Rick Perlstein, Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus.

Introduction
Reference is made to Rick Perlstein's Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus, Hill & Wang, 2001, cited as a comparative resource addressing the evolution of American political history and the emergence of the modern conservative movement. This detailed review of history indicates that Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign was not merely a political defeat but a pivotal moment that significantly influenced subsequent events in the United States. It was the foundation for the significant governmental transformations that ultimately resulted in Ronald Reagan and future developments. This was more than a decade ago, and the fact that these seven hundred and sixty pages are so generously filled with detail is evidence that the author has not only acquired the skill of storytelling but, even more challenging, the skill of recording history. For what has been loudly proclaimed for so long as the ten years that altered the world was, in fact, the decade that a conservative insurgency was quietly preparing the groundwork for, which, one day, was to tip the scales of history in its favor.

Author's Background and Approach
In my opinion Rick Perlstein as a writer offers a new perspective because he is able to mix fact with story. His argument is essentially revisionist, seeking the reintroduction of a story that was largely absent or underrepresented in the majority of texts from the 1960s. Perlstein utilizes narrative history, which involves storytelling and character analysis, while adhering to academic rigor and evidence-based presentation. His style is poetic, film, and the politician, to the reader, is a three dimensional man, so that a multitude of readers can engage in the ideological struggles of history with not the smallest loss of brain. The author adopts a pro-conservative position, which is, of course, the case with the first assumption that the crushing defeat Barry Goldwater suffered in 1964 did not spell the end of conservatism but rather its opening. This bizarre reasoning forces perlstein to see the election outcome through a side-ways lens, as a spectator of the machinery, ideologically pure and populist that the campaign has generated. However, his rhetoric remains conciliatory and empathetic to the right wing demonstrators, yet is critically engaged, an effort to interpret the movement from within rather than merely a conservative critique of liberalism.


Summary of Content and Main Arguments
Perlstein characterizes Before the Storm as a historical account from the period following Eisenhower, during which moderate Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller maintained significant influence within the party, and the liberal consensus was deemed invulnerable. The book begins in 1950s america, where the majority of americans, whether democrats or republicans, enthusiastically supported the new deal welfare state and cold war containment. Perlmeyer's account, which is more in the smug zone, with his motly crew of conservative revolutionaries: intellectuals such as william f. Jr. buckley and the national review crowd and the natives of this new sunbelt and the big donors and the young organizers who believed in small government and anti communism with a fever. It concludes with the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, where Goldwater is nominated, which, according to Perlstein, is a conservative redefinition of the party machinery. This book shows the fight and scuffle between groups of republicans, the decisions of citizen who considered their plans, and the strong opinion that caused some others to stick to their own way. Perlstein, this inflammatory statement by Goldwater is'like being hit with a sledgehammer, and extremism in the name of liberty is a virtue'as one of the major tenets of the movement's philosophical extremism to a practical political strategy. The entire progression of the presidential campaign was a detailed narrative, and Perlstein provides an analysis of how the errors made by the candidate would contribute to the decisive defeat of Goldwaters and which issues would carry lasting importance. In their view, the landslide re-election of lyndon johnson was not meant as a condemnation of liberalism so much as a temporary halt to a movement that was about to change the entire complexion of american political life. Perlstein's primary argument is that the 1964 campaign served as the catalyst for subsequent conservative successes, as it established the operational framework for organizing and energizing supporters, thereby enabling the achievement of electoral success, and most critically, instilled the belief in the efficacy of ideological dedication to such an extent that it would sustain political efforts even in the face of electoral defeat. In this text, Perlstein uncovers numerous interconnected factors: the emergence of a dominant right-wing media entity, substantial financial backing from affluent individuals, increased church influence, the exploitation of middle class fears to sway public opinion during evolving circumstances, and the propagation of rhetoric targeting intellectuals and high-profile figures. He argues that the goldwater campaign constitutes the first stage of ideological separation in the u. s. politics and the disintegration of postwar bipartisan harmony. Perlstein asserts that the fundamental values of the movement—freedom, state authority, and anti-communism—would, in time, appeal to a considerable electorate. People became tired of the long, distant, and complex government of rules and the quickening of the world does not help either. People that felt this way would be drawn to these simple plans.

Analysis of Sources and Methodology
Perlstein did a lot of research he read a lot of primary sources and all of that is what makes this book so good and important. He put together facts from campaign notes, letters, news shows, papers, radio shows, and taped stories to show what right-wing thinkers went through in the 1960s. His footnotes below, citing sources for his work, list the Goldwater papers, archives of groups including Young Americans for Freedom, the Republican National Committee, and personal files of political figures and donors. Author utilizes contemporary sources such as newspapers, magazines, and television broadcasts to record the environment created by the campaign and demonstrate the enthusiasm exhibited by citizens. His glimpse at how folks in the campaign spoke to each other and reached out to main staff provides us with a perspective on the objectives the group aimed to achieve, as well as insight into the desires of the major individuals involved. Nonetheless, information from survivors might provide additional insights, though skepticism is warranted in trusting such reports, given the passage of time and the knowledge that the situation was ultimately resolved, which could skew responses. Perlstein adopts a narrative-driven tone, eschewing analytical critique. his thinking is based on hypothesis or experience of life not evidence or statistics. The application of this approach is neither beneficial nor detrimental under all circumstances. Because of story tell makes this book so enjoyable to read and makes history come alive in such an crazy way. People in the past are not alien they are people. The reader gets a detailed account of the political landscape of the sixties, its actors, struggles, hopes and setbacks that shape the movement conservative. But in this story it would be dangerous because it could be an easy way out of a hard problem. the author traces economic, demographic, and political developments that gave rise to conservatism in the united states but does not analyze the structural causes of the phenomenon: for example, the role of racial dynamics in the development of the conservative movement ; yet the structural critique is not pursued. External attention on colorful figures and sensational occurrences may occasionally divert focus from the structural and economic factors influencing American political systems. Perlstein's emphasis on individual agency and the requirement for individuals to choose between options might lead dissenters to argue that, paradoxically, this focus could reduce the degree to which broader historical forces have historically limited and constrained alternatives.

Critical Analysis and Evaluation
Before the Storm is a very good story history and it make to think what is importent and the story or the analisis Perlstein's primary accomplishment is his role as both interpreter and expounder of the conservative movement, while maintaining an ideological distance. He believe that conservative are good and he doesn't call them bad or evil he call them good options for real problems. This understanding enables analysis of why this movement attracts a significant adherent base and why it has proliferated across a population of millions in the United States. This is a convincing thesis, and it has shaped the historian's view of the 1964-66 era. Perlstein narrates the story effectively; the foundation, language, and supporting groups that contributed to Ronald Reagans presidency were established during Goldwaters campaign. The formations that arose in '64, the donor networks established, the activists sourced and trained, and the ideological structure created would all be imposed. Slightly diverging, he perceives politics not as a means to achieve swift electoral success but as a realm for personal development, thereby adopting a more sophisticated stance on political progress. However, the book's interpretive aspect at times exhibits a tendency toward hyperbole. Perlstein demonstrates a pronounced and occasionally excessively romanticized empathy for his subjects, exemplified by addressing grass roots activists as idealists. Reading is valid, but it also obscures some of the movement's darker obscurities -- its racial politics, its racially charged sentiments. The author talk about these problems but a little less serious then the problem. Readers interested in the history of the fight for rights and the evolution of race relations may find it beneficial to explore in greater depth the historical process through which race became a central issue in right-wing political ideology. This book is really long and heavy of course but its an awesome book and thats what makes you wanna read the whole thing but it might be a little to much. There so many characters to follow and if you don't follow politics in the 1960's then you will be in the mix of all the characters coming in and out. perlstein ' s story is interesting - but too much detail sometimes undermines the book ' s main goal. That ending is a little quick compared to the rest of the book it doesn't really give you that much time to digest the long term effects of the Goldwater moment that you might want. Perlstein's ideology is predominantly moderate, yet their stance is discernible. He's writing as a conservative who's not a conservative, so he can hug and slap. But certain of the more conservative readers have hinted that he has over-rated the intellectual potency of conservatism, while the most liberal critics have maintained that he is too lenient upon the movement, with its perplexing racial and social record. Objections such as these underscore the difficulty of providing objective descriptions of controversial political groups.


Primary Document Analysis
To know why did perlstein said this and how is this include to the time period read the original text of the time period it will tell you the story about the conservative movement. The three written pieces I find most instructive are: barry goldwaters acceptance speech at the 1964 republican national convention, william f. buckley jr s mission statement from the first edition of national review 1955 and the sharon statement issued by young americans for freedom 1960. Document 1: Goldwaters Acceptance Speech, 16 July 1964. Goldwaters acceptance speech at the RNC is what the conservative overthrow that perltstein describes. The most famous quote form the speech is: i would like to remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! and remember moderation in justice is no virtue! This phrase embodies the movement's ideological extremism and its willingness to employ incendiary rhetoric that would be damaging to Goldwater's campaign.
