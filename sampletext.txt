Book Review Rick Perlstein, Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus
Introduction
Rick Perlstein's Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus (Hill & Wang, 2001) represents a landmark work in American political history that fundamentally reshapes our understanding of the conservative movement's origins. This meticulously researched narrative history traces the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater, not as an isolated electoral failure, but as the foundational moment that would eventually transform American politics and give rise to the Reagan Revolution and beyond. Through over 670 pages of richly detailed storytelling, Perlstein challenges the conventional wisdom that the 1960s were primarily defined by liberal and countercultural movements, instead illuminating the parallel insurgency on the political right that was quietly building the infrastructure for future conservative dominance.
Author's Background and Approach
Rick Perlstein, a journalist-historian, brings a unique perspective to this work that bridges academic rigor with narrative accessibility. His approach is fundamentally revisionist, seeking to recover a story that had been largely overlooked or misunderstood in previous accounts of the 1960s. Perlstein employs a narrative history methodology that emphasizes dramatic storytelling and character development while maintaining scholarly standards of evidence and analysis. His writing style is vivid and cinematic, bringing political figures to life in ways that make complex ideological debates accessible to general readers without sacrificing analytical depth.
The author's interpretative framework rests on a central thesis: that Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat in 1964 was not the end of conservative politics but rather its beginning. This counterintuitive argument requires Perlstein to read the election results against the grain, looking beyond vote tallies to examine the organizational networks, ideological commitments, and grassroots energy that the campaign generated. His approach is sympathetic to conservative activists while remaining critically analytical, attempting to understand the movement on its own terms rather than simply as a reaction against liberalism.
Summary of Content and Main Arguments
Perlstein structures Before the Storm as a chronological narrative that begins in the post-Eisenhower era, when moderate Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller dominated the party and a broad liberal consensus seemed unshakeable. The book opens with a portrait of 1950s America where most citizens, regardless of party affiliation, accepted the basic premises of the New Deal welfare state and Cold War containment policy. Into this landscape of complacency, Perlstein introduces a diverse cast of conservative insurgents: intellectual figures like William F. Buckley Jr. and the National Review circle, grassroots activists in the emerging Sunbelt, wealthy donors, and young organizers who shared a vision of limited government and aggressive anti-communism.
The narrative builds toward the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, where Goldwater secured the nomination through what Perlstein characterizes as a conservative takeover of the party establishment. The author provides detailed accounts of the internecine battles within the Republican Party, the strategic maneuvering of campaign operatives, and the ideological debates that animated conservative circles. Perlstein pays particular attention to Goldwater's famous declaration that "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice," positioning this statement as emblematic of the movement's willingness to embrace ideological purity over electoral pragmatism.
The general election campaign receives extensive treatment, with Perlstein documenting both the strategic failures that led to Goldwater's crushing defeat and the deeper currents that would prove more enduring. Lyndon Johnson's landslide victory is presented not as a vindication of liberalism but as a temporary setback for a movement that was fundamentally reshaping American political culture. Perlstein's central argument is that the 1964 campaign created a blueprint for future conservative success: it built organizational infrastructure, identified and mobilized constituencies, tested rhetorical strategies, and most importantly, demonstrated that ideological conviction could inspire sustained political activism even in defeat.
Throughout the book, Perlstein traces several interconnected developments: the growth of a conservative media ecosystem, the cultivation of wealthy donors, the mobilization of religious conservatives, the appeal to middle-class anxieties about social change, and the strategic use of anti-elitism and anti-intellectualism. He argues that the Goldwater campaign marks the beginning of ideological polarization in American politics and the end of the bipartisan consensus that had characterized the postwar period. The movement's emphasis on individual liberty, states' rights, and anti-communism would, according to Perlstein, eventually resonate with voters who felt alienated by bureaucratic liberalism and threatened by rapid social transformation.
Analysis of Sources and Methodology
Perlstein's research is impressively comprehensive, drawing on an extensive array of primary sources that give the book its richness and authority. He consulted campaign archives, personal correspondence, newspaper articles, magazines, television broadcasts, and oral history interviews to reconstruct the world of 1960s conservatism. The book's extensive endnotes reveal the breadth of his archival work, including materials from the Goldwater papers, records of conservative organizations like Young Americans for Freedom, documents from the Republican National Committee, and private collections of key activists and donors.
The author's use of contemporary media sources—newspapers, magazines, television coverage—allows him to capture the public discourse surrounding the campaign and to show how events were understood at the time. His attention to internal campaign documents and private correspondence provides insight into the strategic thinking and personal motivations of key figures. Interviews with surviving participants add another layer of understanding, though these retrospective accounts must be read carefully given the passage of time and the participants' knowledge of how the story ultimately unfolded.
Perlstein's methodology emphasizes narrative over systematic analysis. He builds his interpretation through accumulated detail and dramatic storytelling rather than through explicit theoretical frameworks or quantitative analysis. This approach has both strengths and limitations. The narrative power makes the book highly readable and brings history to life in compelling ways. Characters emerge as complex individuals rather than abstract historical forces. The reader gains a vivid sense of the texture of political life in the 1960s—the personalities, conflicts, hopes, and frustrations that animated the conservative movement.
However, this narrative approach also means that structural factors sometimes receive less attention than they deserve. Economic transformations, demographic shifts, and broader social changes that created the conditions for conservative mobilization are present in the book but not systematically analyzed. The role of racial politics in the conservative movement, for instance, is addressed but could benefit from deeper structural analysis. The focus on colorful personalities and dramatic moments occasionally overshadows the institutional and economic forces shaping American politics. Critics might argue that Perlstein's emphasis on individual actors and their choices understates the degree to which larger historical forces constrained and shaped their possibilities.
Critical Analysis and Evaluation
Before the Storm succeeds brilliantly as narrative history while raising questions about the balance between storytelling and analysis. Perlstein's greatest achievement is making the conservative movement comprehensible and human without endorsing its positions. He takes conservative ideas seriously, presenting them as coherent responses to genuine problems rather than dismissing them as ignorant or malicious. This sympathetic approach allows readers to understand why the movement attracted passionate supporters and why its message resonated with millions of Americans.
The book's revisionist argument—that 1964 was a beginning rather than an ending—is convincing and has reshaped scholarly understanding of the period. Perlstein demonstrates persuasively that the infrastructure, rhetoric, and constituencies that would eventually bring Ronald Reagan to power were forged in the Goldwater campaign. The organizational networks built in 1964, the donor relationships established, the activists trained, and the ideological framework articulated would all prove crucial in subsequent decades. By shifting attention from immediate electoral outcomes to longer-term political development, Perlstein offers a more sophisticated understanding of how political change occurs.
However, the book's interpretative strength sometimes tips toward overstatement. Perlstein's sympathy for his subjects occasionally approaches romanticism, particularly in his portrayal of grassroots activists as principled idealists. While this reading has merit, it can obscure the less attractive aspects of the movement, including its racial politics and its relationship to segregationist sentiment. The author addresses these issues but perhaps with less critical scrutiny than they deserve. The civil rights movement and racial realignment receive attention, but readers might want a more thorough analysis of how race shaped conservative mobilization.
The book's length and density, while reflecting thorough research, can be overwhelming. The cast of characters is enormous, and readers unfamiliar with 1960s politics may struggle to keep track of the many figures who appear and reappear throughout the narrative. Perlstein's storytelling is engaging, but the sheer volume of detail sometimes obscures the larger analytical points. The conclusion feels somewhat rushed given the expansive buildup, offering less reflection on the long-term consequences of the Goldwater moment than one might hope.
Perlstein's ideological positioning is generally balanced, but his perspective is evident. He writes as someone fascinated by conservative politics without being a conservative himself, and this stance allows for both sympathy and critique. However, some conservative readers have argued that he underestimates the genuine intellectual substance of conservative thought, while some liberal readers have suggested he is too generous to a movement with problematic racial and social implications. These criticisms point to the inherent difficulty of writing fairly about deeply contested political movements.
Primary Document Analysis
To fully understand Perlstein's arguments and their implications, it is valuable to examine primary documents from the period that illuminate the conservative movement's development. Three documents are particularly revealing: Barry Goldwater's acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican National Convention, William F. Buckley Jr.'s mission statement from the founding issue of National Review (1955), and the Sharon Statement issued by Young Americans for Freedom (1960).
Document 1: Goldwater's Acceptance Speech (July 16, 1964)
Goldwater's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention represents the culmination of the conservative takeover that Perlstein chronicles. The speech's most famous passage—"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!"—encapsulates both the movement's ideological fervor and its willingness to embrace controversial rhetoric that would ultimately harm Goldwater's electoral prospects.
Reading this document alongside Perlstein's account reveals the tension between ideological purity and electoral pragmatism that runs throughout the book. Goldwater's speech rejected the moderate Republican establishment and embraced a confrontational stance that alienated swing voters. Perlstein argues that while this approach failed in November 1964, it succeeded in energizing a dedicated base of supporters and articulating principles that would guide the conservative movement for decades.
The speech's emphasis on liberty, limited government, and individual responsibility provides textual evidence for Perlstein's argument about the ideological coherence of the conservative movement. Goldwater presents conservatism not as backward-looking nostalgia but as a principled defense of fundamental American values against encroaching government power. His warnings about centralized authority and bureaucratic control spoke to genuine anxieties among middle-class Americans, even if his specific policy proposals proved unpopular. The document confirms Perlstein's interpretation that the Goldwater campaign was fundamentally about ideas rather than mere electoral calculation.
Document 2: William F. Buckley Jr.'s National Review Mission Statement (1955)
Buckley's founding statement for National Review provides crucial context for understanding the intellectual infrastructure of conservatism that Perlstein describes. Buckley declared that the magazine "stands athwart history, yelling Stop," positioning conservatism as resistance to what he saw as dangerous liberal trends. The statement articulated a sophisticated conservative philosophy that combined opposition to communism, defense of free markets, and cultural traditionalism.
This document illuminates Perlstein's discussion of the intellectual networks that preceded and shaped the Goldwater campaign. National Review provided a forum where conservative ideas could be debated, refined, and disseminated. Buckley's emphasis on creating a respectable intellectual conservatism—one that could compete with liberal ideas in universities and elite circles—represents the movement's attempt to build credibility and influence beyond grassroots activism.
The mission statement reveals tensions within conservatism that Perlstein explores: between libertarian economics and social conservatism, between intellectual sophistication and populist appeal, between principled opposition and practical politics. Buckley's attempt to fuse these elements into a coherent ideology provides the intellectual foundation for the political movement that Perlstein chronicles. The document demonstrates that conservatism in the 1950s and 1960s was not merely reactive but offered a positive vision of American society.
Document 3: The Sharon Statement (1960)
The Sharon Statement, issued by Young Americans for Freedom at their founding conference, represents the generational energy that Perlstein identifies as crucial to the conservative movement's success. The document articulates core conservative principles: limited government, free markets, victory over communism, and individual liberty. Its language is direct and idealistic, reflecting the passionate commitment of young conservatives who saw their political engagement as a moral crusade.
This document supports Perlstein's argument about the importance of grassroots organizing and youth activism in building the conservative movement. The founding of YAF marked the emergence of a generation of conservative activists who would staff campaigns, build organizations, and eventually assume leadership positions in the Republican Party. The Sharon Statement's ideological clarity demonstrates that young conservatives were motivated by principles rather than mere partisanship, confirming Perlstein's interpretation of conservatism as a genuine ideological movement rather than simply a political strategy.
The statement's emphasis on freedom and anti-communism connects to broader themes in Perlstein's narrative. These young activists genuinely believed that America faced existential threats from communist expansion abroad and government expansion at home. Their willingness to dedicate themselves to a cause that seemed politically marginal in 1960 demonstrates the depth of commitment that Perlstein argues would sustain the movement through the 1964 defeat and beyond.
Synthesis of Primary Documents and Perlstein's Argument
Examining these three documents alongside Perlstein's narrative reveals how the conservative movement built intellectual credibility (Buckley), organizational infrastructure (YAF), and political leadership (Goldwater) during the decade leading to 1964. The documents confirm Perlstein's central thesis that conservatism emerged as a coherent ideological movement with deep roots rather than as a spontaneous reaction to specific events.
The documents also highlight aspects of the movement that Perlstein could analyze more thoroughly. All three texts emphasize freedom and liberty while saying relatively little about concrete policy implementation. This emphasis on abstract principles over practical governance would create challenges when conservatives eventually gained power, a development that falls outside Perlstein's chronological scope but deserves consideration when evaluating the movement's long-term impact.
The primary sources reveal both the strengths and limitations of Perlstein's approach. His narrative skill in bringing these documents and the people behind them to life is evident, but deeper engagement with the intellectual content and internal contradictions of conservative thought might strengthen the analysis. The documents demonstrate ideological conviction, organizational sophistication, and political courage, supporting Perlstein's sympathetic reading while also raising questions about the relationship between conservative principles and conservative politics that merit further exploration.
Significance and Contribution to Understanding American Political History
Before the Storm has fundamentally reshaped scholarly and popular understanding of postwar American politics. Before Perlstein's book, the 1960s were primarily understood as a period of liberal triumph and cultural revolution, with conservatism appearing as a marginal phenomenon that briefly surfaced in 1964 before disappearing until Reagan's emergence in 1980. Perlstein's revisionist account has made it impossible to maintain this interpretation, demonstrating instead that the 1960s saw the birth of a powerful conservative movement that would eventually transform American politics.
The book's most significant contribution is showing how political movements develop over time through organizational work, ideological development, and persistent activism even when electoral success is absent. Perlstein traces the creation of conservative infrastructure—donor networks, media outlets, grassroots organizations, youth groups—that would prove more important than any single election result. This insight has influenced subsequent scholarship on political mobilization and party transformation, encouraging historians to look beyond electoral outcomes to examine the deeper processes through which political coalitions form and evolve.
Perlstein's work also contributes to understanding American political polarization. By showing how the bipartisan consensus of the 1950s gave way to ideological polarization beginning in the 1960s, the book helps explain the origins of contemporary political divisions. The Goldwater campaign's rejection of moderation and embrace of ideological purity marks a crucial moment in the transformation of American politics from a system based on cross-party coalitions and compromise to one organized around sharply defined ideological camps.
The book bridges journalism and academic history in ways that have influenced both fields. Perlstein demonstrates that narrative history need not sacrifice analytical rigor, while showing that scholarly history can reach beyond academic audiences. His success has inspired subsequent works that combine thorough research with compelling storytelling, contributing to a renaissance of narrative political history.
For understanding the particular period covered, Before the Storm illuminates how rapid social change, Cold War anxieties, and middle-class discontents created opportunities for political mobilization. The book shows how conservative activists successfully channeled inchoate anxieties into a coherent political movement by offering simple but powerful narratives about liberty, government overreach, and national decline. This analysis helps explain not only the 1960s but also recurring patterns in American politics where movements emerge from the margins to reshape national debate.
Limitations and Suggestions for Further Research
Despite its many strengths, Before the Storm leaves important questions underexplored. The relationship between conservative ideology and racial politics deserves deeper analysis. While Perlstein addresses the issue, particularly regarding Goldwater's opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the book could more systematically examine how racial resentment and anxieties about civil rights shaped conservative mobilization. The "states' rights" rhetoric that Perlstein documents clearly had racial implications that merit more thorough investigation.
The book's focus on national politics and elite actors means that regional and local dynamics sometimes receive insufficient attention. The Sunbelt's emergence as a conservative stronghold is noted but could be analyzed more thoroughly in terms of economic development, migration patterns, and changing social structures. Similarly, the religious dimensions of conservatism are present in the narrative but could benefit from more systematic treatment, particularly regarding the mobilization of evangelical Protestants that would become increasingly important in subsequent decades.
Gender and family politics, which would become central to conservative appeals in later decades, are less prominent in Perlstein's account. While this may reflect the actual priorities of the Goldwater campaign, examining how conservative rhetoric about traditional values and social change appealed differently to men and women might enrich the analysis. The role of conservative women as activists and organizers deserves more attention than it receives in the narrative.
The book's periodization, ending essentially with the 1964 election, means that important developments of the late 1960s and 1970s appear only briefly if at all. The evolution of conservatism in response to the Vietnam War, the counterculture, and the Nixon presidency would illuminate how the movement adapted and grew. A longer temporal frame might show which aspects of the Goldwater campaign proved enduring and which were modified or abandoned as circumstances changed.
Future research might examine conservative mobilization comparatively, looking at similar movements in other democracies during the same period. The book's almost exclusive focus on the United States means that transnational influences and parallel developments elsewhere receive little attention. Understanding American conservatism in global context might reveal both its distinctive features and its connections to broader political currents.
Conclusion
Rick Perlstein's Before the Storm stands as an essential work for understanding the origins of modern American conservatism and the transformation of postwar politics. Through meticulous research, compelling narrative, and revisionist interpretation, Perlstein demonstrates that Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign was not a conservative dead end but rather the foundation for decades of political success. The book succeeds in recovering a crucial but overlooked story, challenging readers to recognize that the 1960s saw the birth of conservative insurgency alongside more familiar liberal and countercultural movements.
The book's greatest strengths lie in its narrative power, its sympathetic but critical approach to conservative actors, and its convincing argument that electoral defeat can mask deeper political transformation. Perlstein brings to life a large cast of characters—activists, intellectuals, donors, politicians—showing how their collective efforts built the infrastructure and articulated the ideas that would eventually reshape American politics. His use of diverse primary sources creates a rich, textured account that captures the complexity and contingency of historical events.
The limitations identified—insufficient attention to structural factors, occasional romantic portrayal of conservative actors, overwhelming detail, and questions about racial politics—do not fundamentally undermine the book's achievement. Rather, they point toward productive avenues for future research and suggest the inherent trade-offs in any historical work between narrative accessibility and analytical comprehensiveness.
Analysis of primary documents from the period confirms and extends Perlstein's interpretation. Goldwater's acceptance speech, Buckley's National Review mission statement, and the Sharon Statement all reveal a movement with intellectual coherence, organizational sophistication, and ideological commitment that persisted through electoral defeat. These documents support Perlstein's central argument while also suggesting areas where deeper engagement with conservative thought might enrich the analysis.
Before the Storm has fundamentally reshaped understanding of postwar American politics, demonstrating that conservatism was not a fringe phenomenon but a rising force with deep roots and broad appeal. The book's influence extends beyond the academy, shaping popular understanding of how contemporary political divisions emerged. For anyone seeking to understand modern American conservatism, the polarization of American politics, or the transformation of the Republican Party, Perlstein's work remains indispensable.
In an era of increasing political polarization, Before the Storm offers valuable perspective on how ideological movements emerge and evolve. Perlstein shows that political change often begins at the margins, that organizational work matters as much as electoral results, and that ideas can sustain activists through periods of defeat. Whether one finds this history inspiring or cautionary depends on one's political perspective, but understanding this history is essential for all citizens seeking to make sense of contemporary American politics. Before the Storm is not simply a book about the past; it is a guide to understanding the present and perhaps anticipating the future of American political life.
