Summary of Content and Main Arguments
Perlstein organizes Before the Storm as a chronological narrative that begins in the post-Eisenhower era when moderate Republicans like Rockefeller dominated the party and a broad liberal consensus seemed immutable. The book begins with a depiction of 1950s America, where a majority of the population, irrespective of political party, adhered to the fundamental principles of the New Deal welfare state and Cold War containment strategy. Beyond the comfort zone of this landscape of complacency, perlstein introduces a cast of conservative insurgents: the intellectuals, william f. Jr. and the National Review circle, grassroots activists in the new Sunbelt, affluent benefactors, and youthful organizers united in their aspirations for minimal governmental intervention and vigorous anti-communism. The account culminates with the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, where Goldwater achieved the nomination via what Perlstein describes as a conservative takeover of the party machinery. The writer talks about fights in the Republican Party, what people who run campaigns do to win, and the talks that different groups have about what they believe. The writer goes into what happens inside the group, what helpers do, and how people share their ideas in the group. Perlstein emphasizes Goldwaters renowned statement that 'extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, ' framing this assertion as a defining feature of the movement's priorities, which prioritized ideological purity over electoral success. The general election campaign is given generous treatment, perlstein recounting both the strategic missteps that resulted in the crushing defeat for goldwater and the deeper streams that would prove more enduring. Lyndon Johnsons landslide victory is not offered as a vindication of liberalism but as a temporary setback for a movement that was, in fact, rewriting the American political landscape. Pearlstein asserts that the 1964 campaign set the stage for future conservative achievements by providing a framework for organization, supporter mobilization, communication strategy, and, most significantly, demonstrating that conviction could maintain political involvement despite adverse outcomes. In the book, Perlstein looks at a set of things that are tied together: how a group of right-wing news sources grew, how rich people formed support clubs, how church groups started to get active, how worry and fear in the middle class were used, and how talking against smart or rich people was used on purpose. He asserts that the Goldwater campaign signals the onset of ideological division within American political life and the conclusion of the bipartisan consensus that prevailed during the postwar era. Perlstein said that this group’s push for more choice, rights for each state, and a stand against communism would soon draw in people who no longer liked big, rule-heavy ways of running things. These people worried about how fast life and rules were changing all around them. So, they would find this new plan and way of thinking much easier to trust and follow.
